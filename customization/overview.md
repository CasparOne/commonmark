Customization Overview
======================

This library supports several types of customizations:

* New directives via custom parsers
* Custom renderers
* AST manipulation prior to rendering

## Examples

Some examples of what's possible:

* [Parse Twitter handles into profile links](/customization/inline-parsing#example-1---twitter-handles)
* [Convert smilies into emoticon images](/customization/inline-parsing#example-2---emoticons)
